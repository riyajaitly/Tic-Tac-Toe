# Tic-Tac-Toe

This program allows two users to play Tic-Tac-Toe. The program generates a board with nine cells using the traditional 3 x 3 layout and ask each of two users to choose one cell at a time. The users take turns, and each user marks the board cells with a naught O or a cross X. The game continues until either one of the users won or all cells on the board are marked with O or X. The user won when the three marks (O or X) are located on one line
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The user of this program can also play againts an Artifical Intelligence Player (AI) and a Minimax Player. The Minimax player is a type of AI that uses backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally
